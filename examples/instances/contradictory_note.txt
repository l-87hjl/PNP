UNSATISFIABLE INSTANCE: contradictory.json

This instance is designed to be unsatisfiable due to a circular negation constraint.

Configuration:
- 3 dials
- Negations: Not(1,2), Not(2,3), Not(1,3)
- No OR clauses

Why it's unsatisfiable:

The negation constraints form an impossible triangle:
- Not(1,2): dial 1 and dial 2 must be opposite
- Not(2,3): dial 2 and dial 3 must be opposite
- Not(1,3): dial 1 and dial 3 must be opposite

Analysis:
If dial 1 = TRUE (6):
  → dial 2 = FALSE (1)  [from Not(1,2)]
  → dial 3 = TRUE (6)   [from Not(2,3)]
  → But Not(1,3) requires dial 1 ≠ dial 3
  → Contradiction! Both are TRUE

If dial 1 = FALSE (1):
  → dial 2 = TRUE (6)   [from Not(1,2)]
  → dial 3 = FALSE (1)  [from Not(2,3)]
  → But Not(1,3) requires dial 1 ≠ dial 3
  → Contradiction! Both are FALSE

This creates an impossible constraint system - there is no valid assignment.

In SAT terms, this encodes:
  (x₁ ⊕ x₂) ∧ (x₂ ⊕ x₃) ∧ (x₁ ⊕ x₃)

where ⊕ is XOR (exclusive OR). This formula is always false because:
  x₁ ⊕ x₂ ⊕ x₃ must equal both 0 and 1 simultaneously.
